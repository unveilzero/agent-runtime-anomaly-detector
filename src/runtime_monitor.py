    Blocked action sequences are correlated by ``trace_id`` and by agent
    lineage (the root reached through ``parent_agent_id``). Tracking state is
    never evicted while it is inside the correlation window; when capacity is
    exhausted, new traces and agents are blocked instead. Lineage must be
    reported by a trusted collector. An agent seen without ``parent_agent_id``
    has no known parent yet; the first parent reported for it is adopted and
    is fixed from then on. The correlation window is measured in the
    collector's event timestamps; set ``max_timestamp_skew_seconds`` in live
    deployments.
